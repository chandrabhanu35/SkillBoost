# SkillBoost Progress Tracker

This document tracks what is done, what is in progress, and what to focus on next. Update the checkboxes as you complete items. I will keep this file and the internal task list in sync as we ship features.

## 3) Automation Plan
- I will update this checklist automatically as we complete tasks in the IDE and push commits.
- If you manually check/uncheck items here, just push the changes; I will read them and align my internal task list.
- For deeper automation we can add a GitHub Action to post a summary comment on PRs whenever this file changes. Let me know if you want me to set that up.
